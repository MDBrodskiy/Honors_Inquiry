  \item World War I: The Birth of the Modern Sex Spy

    \begin{itemize}

      \item ``All were equally careless in their intercourse with women and at the height of their passion would whisper into the ear of their companion-in-lust, secrets that were never meant to be thus used. The army did much more to prevent soldiers from becoming infected with venereal disease than to protect them against the grave evil of espionage'' â€” Magnus Hirschfield, \textit{Sexual History of the World War} (1930)

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Civil War

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Rose Greenhow's southern hospitality to Union soldiers was used to obtain information for Confederate generals

    \end{itemize}

  \item Mata Hari

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Dutch exotic dancer, came from humble beginnings

      \item Became a fantasy figure

      \item Suspected of being the German spy H21

      \item Still, Georges Ladoux, who was head of espionage in the French Intelligence agency, enlists her to spy for France

      \item Hari is promised millions for key information about the Germans

      \item Hari's mission sent her to Holland to gain information from a past military lover setting sail from Madrid; her boat was boarded by the British, who took her into custody, as they believed she was a German agent by the name of Clara Benedix

      \item Hari improvises the mission and befriends a Military Major by the name of Kalle

      \item Hari got key information from this new lover

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Where the German aviators were dropping their spies behind enemy lines

          \item The Germans knew that the French had broken their radio code and were regularly spreading disinformation
            
        \end{enumerate}

      \item Hari was incriminated by the Germans, when a message from Madrid to Berlin was intercepted, in which Kalle states that agent H21 was to receive payment at Hari's servant's address

      \item Evidence is questionable because Germans know their code was broken, could be disinformation

      \item Still, Hari is arrested and imprisoned

    \end{itemize}
