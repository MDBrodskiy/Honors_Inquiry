  \item Soviet Recruitment Tac-tics

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Called \textit{verbovka}

      \item ``The recruitment of new informants into the underground network is the most hazardous and difficult task of all intelligence activities. From the very first step the recruiting agent finds himself at a serious disadvantage, because by proposing to a person that he become a spy for the Soviets, the agent exposes his own role even before that person has given his reply. If the answer is negative the net result remains that the recruiter has given himself away \dots This alone shows how skillful and astute the recruiter must be, how softly he must tread to secure a hasty retreat, and what a good judge of men he must be.'' — Alexander Orlov , \textit{Handbook of Intelligence and Guerilla Warfare}, pp. 93-94
