\assignmentSection{Conclusion}

\vspace{-20pt}

\begin{multicols}{2}

  \answer{\begin{itemize} \vspace{-3pt} \item “The Government of the United States has never recognized the Bolshevik authorities and does not consider that its efforts to safeguard supplies at Archangel or to help the Czechs in Siberia have created a state of war with the Bolsheviki.`` \vspace{-7pt} \item This most accurately portrays American attitudes towards Bolsheviks \end{itemize}}

  \answer{\begin{itemize} \item Despite its less aggressive stance, America still wanted to prevent Bolsheviks from maintaining power \vspace{-7pt} \item American troops in Southward expeditions were thanks to Francis' extreme anti-Bolshevism \vspace{-7pt} \item Although initially to combat Germans, a main goal of the intervention was clearly to combat Bolshevism  \end{itemize}}
